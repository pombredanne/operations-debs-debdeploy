On the salt master run

  apt-get install debdeploy-master

The Salt master needs to be restarted manually to re-read the Salt modules
provided by debdeploy:

  systemctl restart salt-master.service

On all other systems run

  apt-get install debdeploy-minion

All Salt minions needs to reload their modules list (since debdeploy provides
new modules):

  salt '*' saltutil.refresh_modules
