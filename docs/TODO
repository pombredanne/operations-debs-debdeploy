Bugs:


Refinements to existing functionality:
- Bash completion for commands and options
- Write initiated deployment jobs into a logfile
- Provide logrotate configs

New feature work:
- Central package database to easily search for affected binary packages
- Add a generic notification mechanism if an update has been deployed
  and create a WMF-specific IRC notification which updates "server admin log"
- Make the logging configurable and add a WMF-specific logging method for
  Logstash
- Implement timed restarts, which restart services not an once, but in
  steps/with delays
