Bugs:


Refinements to existing functionality:
- Bash completion for commands and options
- Provide logrotate configs
- Provide git-style status view of deployments ("debdeploy status-deploy -1")
- Silence the restart false positive for the salt minion itself
- Add a git-style internal pager for commands with a lot of terminal output
- Make the black list in the restart detection code configurable and blacklist
  /var/spool/kafka and /var/lib/elasticsearch in our internal setup
- puppet triggers a run every 30 mins, sometimes updates clash with that, the
  minion should detect a running "apt-get update" and postpone the installation
  run

New feature work:
- Implement a function to list of reverse dependencies of a package (to give
  an estimate what a package is used for on a server group)
- Central package database to easily search for affected binary packages
- Add a generic notification mechanism if an update has been deployed
  and create a WMF-specific IRC notification which updates "server admin log"
- Make the logging configurable and add a WMF-specific logging method for
  Logstash
- Implement timed restarts, which restart services not an once, but in
  steps/with delays
- Allow referencing other server groups, e.g. "foo: @foo-canary, @foo-standard"
- Implement timed updates (with a delay)
