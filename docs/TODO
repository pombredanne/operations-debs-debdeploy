Bugs:
- On a jessie system, if an update ships a new version of a conffile and the
  conffile has been locally modified, dpkg can hang

Refinements to existing functionality:
- Bash completion for commands and options
- Provide logrotate configs
- puppet triggers a run every 30 mins, sometimes updates clash with that, the
  minion should detect a running "apt-get update" and postpone the installation
  run

New feature work:
- Add an internal list of patched packages and emit a warning if a spec file
  is generated for those
- Implement a function to list of reverse dependencies of a package (to give
  an estimate what a package is used for on a server group)
- Add a generic notification mechanism if an update has been deployed
  and create a WMF-specific IRC notification which updates "server admin log"
- Make the logging configurable and add a WMF-specific logging method for
  Logstash
- Implement timed restarts, which restart services not an once, but in
  steps/with delays
- Implement timed updates (with a delay)
