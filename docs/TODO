Bugs:
- On a jessie system, if an update ships a new version of a conffile and the
  conffile has been locally modified, dpkg can hang

Refinements to existing functionality:
- Bash completion for commands and options
- Provide logrotate configs
- puppet triggers a run every 30 mins, sometimes updates clash with that, the
  minion should detect a running "apt-get update" and postpone the installation
  run
- Allow to blacklist packages (e.g. src:linux)

New feature work:
- Add an internal list of patched packages and emit a warning if a spec file
  is generated for those
- Implement timed restarts, which restart services not an once, but in
  steps/with delays
- Implement timed updates (with a delay)
- Add support in restart detection for interpreters and their process runtime
- Support binNMU updates (tricky because fixed version differs on a per binary
  package basis)
